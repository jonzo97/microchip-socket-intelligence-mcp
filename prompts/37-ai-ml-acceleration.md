## Competitive Analysis
| Supplier | Market Position | Key Products | Advantages | Target Markets |
|----------|----------------|--------------|------------|----------------|

## Microchip Position
**Current Status**: No competitive AI acceleration products
**Potential Options**: FPGA-based solutions, future MCU integration
**Reality Check**: Massive R&D gap vs NVIDIA/Intel/Qualcomm
**Barriers**: Software ecosystem, performance requirements, investment needed

## Recommendations
- **Priority Level**: Low (Monitor Only)
- **Action**: Avoid competing directly
- **Strategy**: Focus on AI/ML-adjacent opportunities (sensor interfaces, secure elements for AI systems)
- **Alternative**: Partner/integrate rather than compete
```

This should demonstrate the "avoid" category - markets where Microchip cannot realistically compete.
