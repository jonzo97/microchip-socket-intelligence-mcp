## üõ† MCP Server Setup

### Step 1: Verify Installation

```bash
# Navigate to the MCP server directory
cd /home/jorgill/prompt_dev/mcp-server

# Verify the server builds and runs
npm run build
node dist/server.js
```

‚úÖ **Expected Output:** `Socket Intelligence MCP Server running on stdio`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Claude Code Configuration

### Step 1: Locate Claude Code Configuration

The MCP configuration file location varies by OS:

- **macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows:** `%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` 
- **Linux:** `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

### Step 2: Add Socket Intelligence MCP Server

Edit your `claude_desktop_config.json` file and add the Socket Intelligence server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "socket-intelligence": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/home/jorgill/prompt_dev/mcp-server/dist/server.js"],

- Check that the server builds successfully: `npm run build`
- Ensure Claude Code was fully restarted after config changes
- Check console logs: run `node dist/server.js` manually

**2. Server Crashes on Startup**
```
Error: Module not found
```
**Solutions:**
- Run `npm install` to install dependencies
- Verify Node.js version: `node --version` (should be 18+)
- Check file permissions on the server directory

**3. Draw.io XML Import Issues**
```
Error: Invalid XML format
```
**Solutions:**
- Ensure you copied the complete XML response
- Check for special characters that might be corrupted
- Try the JSON format as fallback: `"output_format": "json"`

**4. Empty or Incomplete Responses**
```
No socket recommendations returned
```
**Solutions:**
- Verify research database exists: check `intelligence-database/` folder
